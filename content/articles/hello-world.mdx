This site is live. Articles are on the way.

I'm building this in public, writing about everything from AI assistants to lead generation to the philosophy of growth. If you're here, you're early.

## What's coming

- How I built a personal AI assistant that actually knows me
- Building a contractor lead generation platform with Claude Code
- The tools and systems behind my daily workflow
- Thoughts on AI, business, and building things that matter

Stay tuned.
