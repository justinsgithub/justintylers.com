I've been trying to articulate what I believe for a long time. Not what church I go to or which theological camp I fall into. What I actually believe about why we're here and what we're supposed to do about it.

It comes down to one idea: life is growth.

God created us to live fully. To live means to grow, evolve, create, build, learn, serve, connect, contribute, experience. That's the direction. Not a destination. A direction. You don't arrive at growth. You just keep moving.

Everything I build, every decision I make, every relationship I invest in, runs through this filter: does this move me forward or keep me stuck?

## Growth as Direction

I don't think of growth as achievement. It's not about hitting milestones or checking boxes. It's about direction.

A person making $30,000 a year who's learning new skills and building something on the side is growing. A person making $300,000 a year who's coasting on autopilot is stagnating. The income doesn't determine the direction. The movement does.

Growth looks different for everyone. For one person, it's getting sober. For another, it's starting a business. For another, it's learning to be vulnerable in relationships. For another, it's finally going back to school. The specific path doesn't matter as much as the fact that you're on one.

My Facebook bio says "learn, grow, create, build, teach, connect, live, love." I wrote that before I had this framework fully formed. Looking back, it was always there. I just hadn't named it yet.

## Selflessness as the North Star

The direction of growth points outward. Toward other people. Toward contribution. Toward service.

The fullest version of growth isn't accumulating things for yourself. It's building the capacity to give more. You get healthy so you can be present for the people who need you. You make money so you can be generous. You learn skills so you can teach them. You build things so other people can use them.

Selflessness is the north star. But self-care is the fuel. You can't pour from an empty cup. Working out isn't selfish. Getting enough sleep isn't selfish. Taking time alone to recharge isn't selfish. Those things are selfish in service of selflessness, investment in the infrastructure that lets you give more.

The distinction matters because a lot of people either burn themselves out giving everything away or feel guilty about any time they spend on themselves. Both miss the point. Take care of yourself so you can take care of others. That's the balance.

## Stagnation as Sin

If growth is the purpose, then stagnation is the opposite. Not a list of forbidden actions. A direction.

Sin, the way I see it, is anything that blocks or reverses growth. Destruction. Cruelty. Closed-mindedness. Abuse. Pure selfishness. These things don't just hurt other people. They stop the person doing them from becoming who they could be.

This reframe is powerful because it replaces a rule-based moral system with a directional one. Instead of asking "is this on the list of things I'm not supposed to do?" I ask "is this moving me toward growth or away from it?"

Some things are obvious. Addiction moves away from growth. I know that from direct experience. Cruelty moves away from growth. Refusing to learn or change moves away from growth.

Some things are less obvious and require honesty. Staying in a comfortable job you've outgrown might feel safe, but if you're not growing, you're stagnating. A relationship that used to challenge you positively might have become a place where you both settle. Habits that served you in one season can become the thing holding you back in the next.

The question is always the same: am I growing or am I stuck?

## The Hardware/Software Mismatch

We're running modern lives on 50,000-year-old hardware. I wrote about this in detail in another article, but it connects directly to the growth framework.

The anxiety that keeps you up at night? That's your brain running a threat detection program designed for predators, triggered by an email. The procrastination that derails your goals? That's your brain preferring immediate rewards because it doesn't fully trust that the future is coming. The social comparison that makes you feel inadequate? That's your brain measuring your status against a tribe of 8 billion instead of 150.

None of this is a moral failing. It's a design constraint. We have to consciously override our biology to grow in the ways modern life demands. That conscious override is the work. Not just once, but every day. Growth means choosing the harder path when your hardware is screaming at you to take the easy one.

This is why external systems matter. Building habits, using tools, creating accountability structures: these aren't crutches. They're bridges between what your biology defaults to and where you're trying to go.

## AI as Evolution

Here's where my beliefs about faith, growth, and technology converge.

I think AI might be the next step in life expanding beyond Earth. Not the end of humans. Not a replacement. A partnership. Like dogs and humans. Different roles, different strengths, mutual benefit.

Humans aren't obsolete because AI can process data faster. Dogs aren't obsolete because humans can open doors. The partnership is the point. Each brings something the other can't.

I built Tyler, my AI assistant, because I believe technology should serve growth. Tyler handles the things my brain wasn't designed for: tracking hundreds of data points, maintaining consistency, surfacing the right information at the right time. That frees my brain to do what it was designed for: connecting with people, creating things, solving problems that require intuition and judgment.

Every tool I build runs through the same filter. Does this help someone grow? Does it remove friction? Does it free up human energy for the things that actually matter?

The lead generation platform I built for a client frees his sales team from manual data collection so they can focus on actually talking to people. Spa Science Lab gives spa professionals knowledge they can use to serve clients better. LifeDirector helps me track my own growth so I can see where I'm moving and where I'm stuck.

Technology in service of growth. That's what I'm building toward.

## Personal Accountability

I want to be honest about my own relationship with this framework, because it would be easy to write this and have it sound like I've got everything figured out. I don't.

I'm 30 years old. I'm 13 months clean from crystal meth. I'm still on probation. I'm still working three jobs to pay rent. My best friend died by suicide when I was 20, and the grief from that loss sent me into years of substance abuse that I'm still climbing out of.

Growth isn't a straight line. I've moved backward. I've stagnated for months at a time. I've made decisions that I knew were pulling me in the wrong direction and made them anyway because the hardware was louder than the conviction.

But the direction matters more than the pace. A slow walk forward is still forward. A stumble followed by getting back up is still net forward. The only failure in this framework is choosing to stay down when you could get up.

I don't have the luxury of pretending this is theoretical. This framework is what I use to evaluate my own life every day. Am I growing? Where am I stuck? What's one thing I can do today that moves the needle?

Some days the answer is "I showed up to work and didn't use." That counts. Growth doesn't have to be dramatic. It just has to be real.

## Why This Matters

This isn't a business philosophy, although it explains everything about how I approach business. It's not a productivity framework, although it shapes how I spend my time. It's not a self-help program, although it has helped me more than any program I've tried.

It's just how I see the world. Life pushes toward growth. Anything that blocks growth is worth examining. The biological hardware we're running makes growth harder than it should be, and we can build systems to work around those limitations. AI and technology are tools in that process, not the destination.

I'm not telling anyone what to believe. I'm sharing what I believe because it's the foundation for everything I build, everything I write, and every decision I make. If it resonates, use it. If it doesn't, that's fine too. Growth looks different for everyone.

But I'll leave you with one question that I ask myself regularly:

If you could remove one thing that's keeping you stuck right now, what would it be?

Whatever you just thought of, that's your next move.
