I'm tired of AI articles that read like science fiction. "AI will revolutionize every industry." "The future of work is here." "10 ways AI will transform your business by 2030."

Cool. What can it do for me this week?

I build AI-powered tools for small businesses. Not theoretical tools. Real scripts running on real servers solving real problems for real clients right now. Here are three things that work today.

## 1. Lead Research: Stop Googling One by One

Every business needs customers. Most small businesses find them the hard way: word of mouth, cold calls from bought lists, or someone sitting at a desk Googling businesses one at a time and copying contact info into a spreadsheet.

That last method is still shockingly common. I've seen it. Someone spending 20 hours a week searching for potential clients, clicking through websites, writing down phone numbers. Manually.

Here's what I built instead: a system that scrapes public government databases for licensed contractor data. State licensing boards, Secretary of State filings, county records. Every state requires contractors to register, and that data is public. My system pulls it automatically.

The numbers: 1.4 million leads across 15+ states. Each record includes business name, license type, address, and (after enrichment) phone number. The system runs scrapers for 65+ data sources, normalizes everything into a standard format, deduplicates across sources, and enriches missing phone numbers through Google Business search.

My client uses this for cold calling. Instead of his team spending hours finding contacts, they open a spreadsheet with thousands of verified leads ready to dial.

The data is free. It's sitting in government databases right now. You just need someone to go get it.

This isn't hypothetical. I built this. It runs. The leads convert into real sales calls.

## 2. Follow-Up Sequences: Because Humans Forget

Here's a number that should bother you: the average business responds to a new lead in 47 hours. Almost two full days. By then, the customer has already called your competitor.

The problem isn't laziness. It's that people are busy. A lead comes in at 2pm. You're on a job site. You get back to the office at 5pm. You have 15 other things to handle. The follow-up slips to tomorrow. Tomorrow has its own fires. By the time you remember, the lead is cold.

AI doesn't forget. Automated follow-up sequences triggered by customer actions fire every time, on time. A form gets submitted? Response goes out in 5 minutes. Customer opens an email but doesn't reply? Follow-up goes out 24 hours later with a different angle. Third touch, fourth touch, each one slightly different, each one timed based on what the customer actually did.

This isn't a generic drip campaign blasting the same template to everyone. Smart sequences adapt. If the customer clicked on pricing, the follow-up talks about pricing. If they looked at a specific service, the follow-up mentions that service. The system pays attention so your team doesn't have to.

The conversion difference between responding in 5 minutes versus 47 hours is massive. Studies consistently show that leads contacted within the first hour are 7x more likely to convert than those contacted after 24 hours.

An automated follow-up system costs a few hundred dollars to build. Missing leads because nobody remembered to email back costs you every day it goes unfixed.

## 3. Data Entry: Build a Bridge

If someone on your team is typing information from one system into another, that's a solved problem. Full stop.

I see this constantly. An order comes in through the website. Someone copies the customer info into the accounting software. Then copies the order details into the inventory system. Then creates an entry in the scheduling tool. Four systems, one order, all manual entry.

Every one of those systems has an API or an integration point. A script can watch for new orders and automatically push the data everywhere it needs to go. No humans typing. No copy-paste errors. No "I forgot to update the inventory" moments.

The examples are everywhere:

- Customer fills out a contact form, and the data goes straight into your CRM and triggers a follow-up email.
- A new appointment gets booked online, and it appears in your scheduling system, sends a confirmation, and creates an invoice draft.
- A sale closes in your POS, and inventory updates, accounting records the revenue, and the customer gets added to your loyalty list.

These bridges between systems aren't complicated to build. Most take a day or two. But they save hours every week, and they eliminate the errors that come from manual data transfer.

The ROI on eliminating data entry is almost always positive within the first month. If you're paying someone $20/hour to do data entry for even 5 hours a week, that's $400/month. A one-time build to automate it pays for itself before the second invoice.

## The Bigger Picture

AI won't replace your business. But a competitor using AI will outwork you. Not because their product is better or their team is smarter. Because their systems handle the repetitive work while their people focus on the work that actually requires a human.

These three automations, lead research, follow-up sequences, and data entry bridges, aren't impressive on a tech conference stage. Nobody's giving a keynote about "we built a script that copies data between two databases." But they save real hours, catch real revenue that would otherwise slip through the cracks, and compound over time.

The businesses that win aren't the ones with the fanciest tools. They're the ones that eliminated the dumb work first.

## What's Your Biggest Time Drain?

Every business has one. A task that eats hours every week, that everyone knows could be better, that nobody has fixed because "that's just how we do it."

That's usually where I start with clients. Find the biggest time drain. Automate it. Move on to the next one.

If you're curious what that would look like for your business, I'm happy to talk about it. No pitch, just a conversation about what's possible. Reach out at justintylers.com.
