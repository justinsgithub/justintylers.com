I work the front desk at a tanning spa. I cater events for a BBQ company on nights and weekends. I do event marketing for a gutter company. Three jobs, three bosses, three schedules I don't control.

And somewhere in between all of that, I built a lead generation platform with 1.4 million contractor records, a personal AI assistant that knows my finances and relationships, an educational platform with 34 articles and 166 ingredient profiles, and a personal dashboard that tracks my health, goals, and habits.

This isn't a "quit your job and follow your dreams" story. I haven't quit anything. I still clock in at Slick Rock Tanning & Spa five days a week. I still work late nights at Drummin Up BBQ. I still run event marketing campaigns for Leafguard. The difference is that now I also build software, and the software has more upside than all three jobs combined.

## The Ceiling

The math on trading time for money is brutal once you see it.

At a tanning spa, I can sell one membership at a time. I can upsell one lotion at a time. I can check in one customer at a time. My output is capped by the hours I'm standing behind that counter. If I get really good at sales, maybe I make an extra few hundred a month in commission. That's the ceiling.

Catering is the same. I can work one event at a time. I can serve one table at a time. More hours means more money, but the ratio never changes. Ten hours of work will always be ten hours of pay.

Event marketing is slightly better because campaigns can run while I sleep. But I'm still executing someone else's strategy for someone else's business.

None of these jobs scale. None of them compound. None of them build anything that keeps working after I stop.

Software is different. A scraper I built three months ago still runs. A website I deployed in January still gets traffic. Code I wrote at 2am while exhausted from a catering shift keeps generating value while I'm sleeping, working, or doing anything else. That's leverage. That's the thing I was missing.

## The On-Ramp

I didn't go to college for computer science. I don't have a CS degree. What I have is Claude Code, Anthropic's CLI tool that gives me an AI development partner that can read files, write code, run tests, and iterate in real time.

The learning curve was steep but navigable. I'd describe what I wanted to build, Claude would write the first version, and I'd learn by reading the code it produced, asking why it made certain decisions, and modifying things when they weren't right. It's like having a senior developer sitting next to you who never gets tired and never judges your questions.

The first real project was ACE, the contractor lead generation platform. A client needed leads to cold call. State licensing boards publish contractor data publicly, but extracting it requires building scrapers for each state's unique website. With Claude Code, I built scrapers for 15+ states, a data pipeline for cleaning and enriching the records, and a full CRM application for managing and selling the leads. 1.4 million records. Real client, real revenue.

That proved the model. One person with AI tooling can build production software that generates money.

## What I've Built

**ACE (Lead Generation Platform):** 1.4 million contractor leads scraped from state licensing boards across 15+ states. Phone enrichment via Google Business Search. A full CRM with role-based access, Stripe billing, and CSV export. This is a real business with a real client.

**Tyler (Personal AI Assistant):** An AI that runs on Claude Code with file-based memory, automatic context injection, and a Telegram interface. It knows my finances, my schedule, my relationships, my recovery status. It sends me morning briefings and evening reflections. I gave it my middle name.

**Spa Science Lab (Educational Platform):** 34 articles about tanning science, red light therapy, skincare, and spray tanning. 166 ingredient profiles. 211 glossary terms. Interactive visualizations. Learning paths with quizzes. Built from my knowledge working in the spa industry.

**LifeDirector (Personal Dashboard):** Tracks health, habits, goals, and finances. Connects to Tyler for AI-powered insights. Cron jobs push daily briefings, habit nudges, and weekly summaries.

All of these were built in the gaps between shifts. Early mornings before work. Late nights after catering. Weekends when I wasn't marketing gutters.

## The Reality

I want to be honest about what this looks like day to day. It's not glamorous.

I'm 30, living in Coeur d'Alene, Idaho, splitting rent on a duplex. I'm paycheck to paycheck most months. I'm still on probation, still going to classes three times a week, still working through the consequences of past decisions. I'm not writing this from a home office with a standing desk and a latte. I'm writing this in the cracks between obligations.

But the trajectory has changed. Six months ago, I was just a guy with three jobs and no leverage. Now I'm a guy with three jobs, a software business (Justins Productions LLC), real projects I can point to, and skills that compound every week. The jobs pay my bills. The software is building my future.

## What Changed

The tools changed. That's the honest answer.

Five years ago, building a lead generation platform with 1.4 million records required a team: backend developers, frontend developers, data engineers, DevOps. Today, one person with Claude Code can do it. Not a prototype. Not a demo. A production system with real users and real revenue.

AI-assisted development didn't make me a 10x developer. It made me a developer at all. I went from "I can't build this" to "I built this and it works and someone is paying me for it." That's not a 10x improvement. That's an infinity-x improvement. From zero to one.

If you're working multiple jobs and thinking about building something on the side, the barriers have never been lower. You don't need a CS degree. You don't need to quit your job. You don't need funding or a co-founder or permission.

You need an idea, a tool like Claude Code, and the discipline to build in the margins. The margins are small. But software scales in a way that time-for-money jobs never will.

I'm still figuring it out. I'm still grinding. But for the first time, the grind is building something that lasts.
