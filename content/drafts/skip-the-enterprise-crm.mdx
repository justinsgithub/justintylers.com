I work at a tanning spa. I do catering on the side. I run event marketing for a gutter company. And I build custom software for small businesses.

That last job is the one that showed me a pattern I can't unsee: small businesses paying enterprise prices for tools they barely use.

## The Pattern

Here's how it usually goes. A business owner with 3 to 15 employees decides they need to "get organized." They Google "best CRM software." They find Salesforce, HubSpot, Monday.com, Zoho. They sign up for a free trial. They get the sales pitch. They commit to $50 to $200 per user per month.

Six months later, they're using the contact list and maybe the email templates. That's 3% of what they're paying for. The other 97%, the pipeline analytics, the custom workflow automation, the advanced reporting, the API integrations, the team collaboration features, sits there untouched.

They're driving a semi truck to the grocery store.

## What Small Businesses Actually Need

I've talked to enough small business owners to see what they really need. It's almost never a full CRM. It's usually one of three things.

### A Way to Find Leads

Most small businesses find customers through word of mouth, Google searches, or buying overpriced lead lists. There's a better way.

I built a lead generation platform that scrapes public government databases for contractor licensing data. State licensing boards, Secretary of State filings, county records. This data is free and publicly available. My system pulls it, cleans it, enriches it with phone numbers, and delivers it ready for cold calls.

The result: 1.4 million contractor leads across 15+ states. My client pays a fraction of what a data broker would charge, and the data is fresher because I can re-scrape monthly.

A small business doesn't need Salesforce to find customers. It needs someone to go get the data that's already out there.

### Automated Follow-Up

Humans forget to email back. It's not a character flaw. It's just reality. You get busy, the follow-up falls off your list, and a warm lead goes cold.

AI doesn't forget. Automated follow-up sequences triggered by customer actions (opened an email, visited a page, submitted a form) convert significantly better than manual outreach. Not because the emails are better. Because they actually get sent.

This doesn't require HubSpot's $800/month Marketing Hub. It requires a script that watches for triggers and sends emails on a schedule. That's a weekend build for a developer. A few hundred dollars one time versus thousands per year.

### A Simple Dashboard

Enterprise CRMs have 47 tabs because they serve 47 different use cases. Your small business has maybe 3.

One owner I talked to just needed to see: how many leads came in this week, which ones have been contacted, and what's the close rate. Three numbers. He was paying $150/month per user for a tool that could show him those three numbers buried inside a system designed for a 500-person sales team.

A custom dashboard showing exactly what matters, nothing more, costs less to build than a single month of that enterprise subscription.

## The Real Cost Comparison

Let's do the math.

**Enterprise CRM for a 5-person team:**
- HubSpot Sales Hub Professional: $100/user/month = $500/month = $6,000/year
- Salesforce Sales Cloud: $80-165/user/month = $400-825/month = $4,800-9,900/year
- Add implementation, training, and customization: easily $5,000-15,000 upfront

**Custom solution:**
- Lead scraping script: $500-2,000 one-time
- Automated follow-up system: $500-1,500 one-time
- Simple dashboard: $500-1,500 one-time
- Hosting: $20-50/month
- Total first year: $1,500-5,000 + hosting

The custom solution costs less than the enterprise CRM's first year, and year two is basically just hosting costs. The enterprise CRM keeps charging the same rate forever.

## When Enterprise Tools Do Make Sense

I'm not saying enterprise CRMs are always wrong. They make sense when:

**Your team is large.** Once you have 50+ salespeople who need to coordinate, share pipelines, and report to management, the collaboration features of Salesforce justify the cost. The problem is a 5-person shop buying the same tool.

**Compliance requires it.** Healthcare, finance, and government contractors often need specific audit trails, data handling certifications, and compliance features that enterprise tools provide. A custom script won't pass a SOC 2 audit.

**Workflows are genuinely complex.** If your sales process has 12 stages, requires approvals from multiple departments, and integrates with ERP systems, you probably need an enterprise tool. But most small businesses have a simple funnel: lead comes in, you call them, you close or you don't.

**You have dedicated IT staff.** Enterprise tools come with enterprise complexity. If you have someone whose job is managing and customizing the CRM, it works. If the owner is also the IT department (which describes most small businesses I know), that complexity becomes a liability.

## The Real Problem

The real problem isn't the tools. It's the assumption that bigger means better.

Small business owners see what the big companies use and assume they need the same thing. Salesforce's marketing is designed to make you feel like you're falling behind without it. HubSpot's free tier exists specifically to get you hooked before upselling.

But a 10-person roofing company doesn't have the same problems as a 500-person SaaS company. Their tools shouldn't look the same either.

## What I Build

My business, Justins Productions LLC, builds custom software for small businesses. The pitch is simple: tell me what problem you're actually trying to solve, and I'll build exactly that. Nothing more, nothing less.

One client needed contractor leads for cold calling. I built a scraping and enrichment pipeline. Another needed a way to track customer interactions without learning a complex CRM. That's a simple database with a clean interface.

The tools I build are boring by enterprise standards. No AI-powered predictive analytics. No machine learning pipeline scoring. Just scripts that do the thing you need done, reliably, for a fraction of what you'd pay for a tool that does a thousand things you don't need.

If you're a small business owner paying for software you barely use, that's money you could be spending on growth. Or, honestly, just keeping in your pocket.

What's the most expensive tool you're paying for that you could replace with something simpler?
